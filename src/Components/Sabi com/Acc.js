            <Accordion.Body>
              We accept all major credit cards, PayPal, and (in select
              countries) direct debit. We also support transactions in a range
              of currencies.

              <h5> How do I switch to a different plan?</h5>
            </Accordion.Header>
            <Accordion.Body>
              You can switch to a new plan at any time by going to the Billing
              page in your account. Select the plan youâ€™d like to switch to and
              immediately start using new features.

            </Accordion.Header>
            <Accordion.Body>
              Yes. If you send emails infrequently and prefer to pay as you go,
              you can buy email credits as an alternative to a monthly plan.

            <Accordion.Body>
              We do indeed. If you have more than 200,000 contacts, we have a
              high-volume plan that can meet your needs.

              News Letter will automatically bill you for your overages. As long
              as you pay for your overages on time, we will not stop your
              campaigns or pause your account.
